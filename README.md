### Submision Questions
* How did this go, overall? - Wasn't too bad. We had sufficient guidance to make it easier to develop this app.
* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far? I did like this process of creating a repo with multiple files  to be used for a single assignment. Made it easier and more intresting. it gives me some enlightenement on how developers do their work 
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? The assignment did not take long since we had some solid guidance. I spent most of the time trying to improve the css, HTML and JavaScript files

### Lab 3
* How did this go, overall? challenging but good learning experience
* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far? Loops are intresting
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? it took 5hours, I though it would have taken less.
